# Network Crawler Architecture - Technical Deep Dive

The network discovery crawler is the heart of SecureCartographyVSC, responsible for connecting to network devices, gathering topology information, and building a comprehensive map of the network. This document provides a thorough analysis of the crawler's architecture, components, and processes.

## Core Architecture

The crawler is built around a highly modular, event-driven architecture implemented entirely in JavaScript. It follows a layered design that separates connectivity, parsing, and data management concerns.

### Key Components

#### 1. NetworkDiscovery Class

The `NetworkDiscovery` class is the orchestration engine for the entire discovery process. It:

- Manages the overall discovery workflow
- Tracks visited and discovered devices
- Handles credential management
- Coordinates device connectivity
- Processes discovery results
- Builds the network topology map
- Generates output files

As an `EventEmitter`, it provides asynchronous status updates throughout the discovery process, allowing the UI to reflect real-time progress.

#### 2. SynchronousSSHClient Class

The `SynchronousSSHClient` (from `ssh-client2.js`) provides a pure JavaScript implementation of SSH, enabling:

- Secure connection to network devices
- Authentication with various credential types
- Command execution and response capture
- Session management
- Error handling and recovery

This component is crucial as it allows the extension to function without external SSH dependencies.

#### 3. ExtensibleParser Class

The `ExtensibleParser` is a sophisticated multi-method parser that:

- Supports both TextFSM template-based parsing and regex-based parsing
- Dynamically loads templates from configurable directories
- Cleans and normalizes device command output
- Extracts structured data from unstructured text
- Prioritizes parsing methods based on reliability

This flexible parsing engine is key to supporting diverse network device types and command outputs.

## Data Structures

### 1. Credential Class

Represents authentication credentials with properties:
- `username` - User identity for authentication
- `password` - Password for password-based authentication
- `keyFile` - Path to private key for key-based authentication
- `keyPassphrase` - Passphrase for encrypted private keys
- `port` - SSH port (defaults to 22)
- `enablePassword` - Enable-mode password for privileged commands
- `authPriority` - Priority order for attempting multiple credentials

### 2. DiscoveredDevice Class

Represents a discovered network device with comprehensive attributes:
- Basic identity: `hostname`, `ipAddress`
- Classification: `deviceType`, `platform`
- Hardware info: `serialNumber`, `model`, `macAddress`
- Software info: `softwareVersion`
- Network info: `interfaces`, `neighbors`, `managementIp`
- Connectivity status: `visited`, `failed`, `reachabilityStatus`
- Discovery metadata: `discoveredAt`, `lastUpdate`, `hopCount`
- Capability data: `capabilities`, `systemDescription`

### 3. ParseTemplate Class

Configuration for a parsing template:
- `method` - Parsing method (TextFSM or Regex)
- `template` - The actual template content
- `priority` - Execution priority (lower values = higher priority)
- `name` - Identifier for the template

### 4. ParseMethod Enumeration

Defines the supported parsing methods:
- `TEXTFSM` - Structured parsing using TextFSM templates
- `REGEX` - Pattern-based parsing using regular expressions

## Discovery Process

The discovery process follows a methodical workflow:

### 1. Initialization

- Load configuration settings from VS Code or defaults
- Set up template paths and output file locations
- Initialize data structures for tracking visited devices
- Load and configure parsing templates

### 2. Template Management

- Load TextFSM templates from configured directories
- Map network commands to appropriate templates
- Set up regex fallback templates
- Sort templates by parsing priority

### 3. Discovery Execution

The core discovery function (`discoverSingleThreaded`) performs:

1. **Reachability Validation**:
   - Checks if the device is reachable via TCP
   - Attempts DNS resolution if TCP fails
   - Updates device IP if DNS resolution succeeds

2. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Iterates through provided credentials
   - Attempts secure SSH connection
   - Escalates privileges if needed

3. **Command Execution**:
   - Runs discovery commands (CDP/LLDP neighbors)
   - Captures command output
   - Logs execution results

4. **Response Parsing**:
   - Processes raw command output
   - Applies appropriate TextFSM templates
   - Falls back to regex parsing if needed
   - Extracts structured neighbor data

5. **Topology Building**:
   - Creates `DiscoveredDevice` objects for neighbors
   - Updates interface connection information
   - Builds parent-child relationships
   - Marks devices for future discovery

6. **Recursive Discovery**:
   - Queues newly discovered devices
   - Processes devices up to configured hop limit
   - Applies exclusion patterns
   - Tracks discovery progress

### 4. TextFSM Parsing System

The TextFSM parsing implementation:

1. **Template Loading**:
   - Reads template files from disk
   - Validates template structure
   - Maps commands to template files

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Removes control characters and ANSI sequences
   - Normalizes line endings
   - Handles encoding issues

3. **Template Application**:
   - Applies structured templates to normalized text
   - Extracts data fields according to template patterns
   - Converts raw matches to structured objects

4. **Post-processing**:
   - Cleans extracted values
   - Handles type conversions
   - Implements fallback mechanisms

### 5. Result Generation

Once discovery completes:
- Constructs comprehensive device topology
- Generates connection maps
- Saves results to configured output file

## Connectivity Features

### 1. Reachability Testing

The `isReachable` function provides sophisticated device reachability testing:

- Attempts direct TCP connection to SSH port
- Handles timeouts and connection failures
- Falls back to DNS resolution if TCP fails
- Returns detailed reachability status

### 2. Credential Management

The discovery process handles credentials intelligently:

- Tries multiple credentials in priority order
- Caches successful credentials for similar devices
- Handles various authentication methods
- Properly manages authentication failures

### 3. DNS Resolution

DNS functionality enhances connectivity:

- Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
- Attempts reverse lookups for IP-only devices
- Updates device information based on DNS data
- Handles DNS failures gracefully

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Pure JavaScript Implementation

The entire crawler is implemented in pure JavaScript with:

- Native `net` module for TCP connections
- Native `dns` module for hostname resolution
- Custom SSH client implementation
- JavaScript-based TextFSM parser
- No external process dependencies

### Asynchronous Architecture

The discovery uses JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities:

A comprehensive logging system provides diagnostic capabilities:

- Contextual information
- Support for external logging integration

### Error Handling

Robust error handling ensures reliability:

- Device-level failure isolation
- Graceful recovery from connection failures
- Detailed error messages and stack traces
- Continuous operation despite individual device failures

## Integration Points
